Week 1:
Created group and ran through all of the week 1 tasks, such as setting up Jira.
Looked through the available projects, and choose project 22, a conference volunteer management system.

Week 2:
Continued other smaller tasks such as creating github repo. Discussed in more depth how we might tackle this system, 
which involved group brainstorming and sketches on whiteboards. Divided work into a front end and backend team
based on skillset. Organising meeting with the client.

Week 3:
Unfortunately I was unable to attend the clinet meeting as the time we set including other groups clashed.
Managed to get a better understanding as a team on the scope of the project, and what we can/can't do. So we 
had to adapt our plan accordingly. Worked on the report, on the user stories and the architecture diagram.
Started investingating Google firebase as one of our core technologies.

Week 4: 
We made a start on the technical side. Specifically, re-famarliarsing with flask, and REST. Created a firebase project.
Started on the auth, user and conference backend, which is fairly trivial as it is just a wrapper around database 
calls. 

Week 5: 
Completed backend functionality for user auth and conferences, and tied them together with the backend. 
Combined the backend functionality with some of the front end, integration is still a WIP.
Had our demo on Thursday.

Week 6:
Finished off sprint 1 tasks. Discussed what parts to do for sprint 2.

Week 7:
Implemented event schedules for conferences. Implemented backend routes + database functions.

Week 8:
Project demo part 2 this week. Fixed up schedules functions

Week 9:
Implemented nearby location finding using the Google Map's API. Also implemented feedback and rating functionality in the backend.

Week 10:
Preparing for demo, and fixing up bugs in week 9 work, as well as working with the frontend team to get everything integrated. Report writing
and wrapping up for the course.
